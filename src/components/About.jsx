      <p className="mb-4">
        Founded in 2017, <strong>Catapalooza, Inc.</strong> began as a grassroots effort to help two kittens abandoned in a shopping bag. Today, weâ€™re a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to rescuing, fostering, and rehoming thousands of cats across East Orlando.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        What started as a good deed by a few passionate women has grown into a community-driven mission to provide cats and kittens with safe, loving homes. We work tirelessly to extend our reach and ensure that every feline gets the second chance they deserve.
