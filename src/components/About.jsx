        About Catapalooza
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Founded in 2017, <strong>Catapalooza, Inc.</strong> started as a grassroots effort to rescue two abandoned kittens. Since then, we have grown into a dedicated 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on rescuing, fostering, and rehoming thousands of cats across East Orlando.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Our mission is to promote humane care for abandoned, abused, and unwanted cats. We work to give every feline a second chance at life by finding them loving homes and educating the public on the importance of spaying and neutering.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In addition to our adoption program, we run a Trap, Neuter, and Return (TNR) initiative, which helps reduce overpopulation and supports the community by providing resources like low-cost vet services.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Serving neighborhoods across East Orlando, including Waterford Lakes, Avalon Park, and Stoneybrook, weâ€™re committed to improving the lives of stray and abandoned cats, while fostering a compassionate community.
      </p>
